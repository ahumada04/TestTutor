# TestTutor

A program created within javaFX to help when a Math Interim is only a few days away. Utalizing SQLite, this program can store users, their progress, and even past test "seeds" if they want to continue studying.

When work and school eases up, I plan for future features such as: 
- Fully implementing the storing of past "test seeds"
- Creating more question items for the other Math 2A-2D classes
- Fully functional smart UI that allows for user to dynamically edit what they want within their practice test
- Larger Visual revamp to be more lively
