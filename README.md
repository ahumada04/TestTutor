# TestTutor

A program created within javaFX to help when a Math Interim is only a few days away. This application creates and administers practice tests for Calculus coursework while grading these tests as well. Utilizing SQLite, this program can store users, their progress, and even past test "seeds" if they want to continue studying. 

If you follow [this link]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RbiIGSpP8TjdEAlFp1FpUlXm-EpgQVPr/view?usp=sharing)), you'll be able to access a jar file to run on your own computer. It may not be fully up to date but I will be updating this link when major changes have been created.

TODO: 
- Fully implementing the storing of past "test seeds"
- Creating more question items for the other Math 2A-2D classes
- Fully functional smart UI that allows users to dynamically edit what they want for their practice test
- Larger Visual revamp to be more lively
